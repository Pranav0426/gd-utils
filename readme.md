# Gd-Utils

 Gd-Utils is just another tool which helps in bypassing the 750GB daily transfer limit by Google.

:octocat: This fork is an English version of Gd-Utils by [@iwestlin](https://github.com/iwestlin)

:octocat: All I have done is to edit the code and use Google Translate to translate Chinese to English. So all credits to the OP.

:octocat: I have only included the installation part for running `Gd-Utils` on your system ([Telegram Bot part is here](https://github.com/roshanconnor123/Gdutils_Tgbot))
## General Instructions
Like other tools (Autorclone/Folderclone/Gclone/Fclone)  Gd-Utils is also based upon Service Accounts aka SAs.

 Among these tools only `Autorclone` and `Folderclone` can generate SAs by themselves.
 
>Therefore for this tool to work you need SAs generated using either [Autorclone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) or [Folderclone](https://github.com/Spazzlo/folderclone)

### ðŸ“¦ Pre-Requisites:

This tool can be used on **Microsoft Windows**, **Android** and **GNU/Linux**.

ðŸ“£ You will need already generated **SAs**.

ðŸ“£ If you are using this on **GNU/Linux** or **Android**:-

Create a new repository on Github and name it as `accounts` then upload all your SAs (.json files) there.
